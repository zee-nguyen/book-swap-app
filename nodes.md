### Issue 1 - Implement search - INDEX and ALL BOOKS page

With search form in ALL BOOKS page, I want to make an ajax call, get JSON data and display them without refreshing the page. However, once the button is clicked or user hits enter, the form is sent to server and ajax can't capture the data.

### Issue 2

There seems to be a lag when user creates new book. I tried to create a new book when already logged in but after input all info and hit "Create new book", I was brought back to the login page and the book wasn't created.


## TODO

1. Fix the issue when user login with incorrect password or username to display a message of the error

2.
